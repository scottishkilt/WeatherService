# WeatherService


Hi!


If you are reading this, thanks for taking the time to look at my app!

I'm really keen on being a tech evangelist, and keen on Docusign specifically.

Despite that I did the stupid thing and decided that this would be the perfect time 
to learn React Native! So I did. Here it is! Boom. You asked for one app, you got two.

TWO APPS.

Isn't that great, now you have TWICE the quality weather forecasting fun. 

Well, at least you CAN have two apps. I don’t have a paid apple developer account. If you want to either give me $99 or access to yours, I’d be happy to provide the iPhone app!

I didn't know if you wanted me to release it to the app store, etc, so the android APK is just included
in the top level of this repo. I was able to run the app and test it via drag and dropping the APK onto
an Android emulator (avn).

Of course I've probably shot myself in the foot by deciding to learn a new library rather than straight up
coding in Java, which I do for my dayjob. I'm only doing a bit of input sanitation, I'm sure there are a few
UI cleanups that would be preferable, I'm missing the edge cases for non-US locales. Let's not even get started
on the error handling and reporting, I should be throwing up alerts for bad calls. There is even a lot cool logic 
and visuals to be made with the sheer wealth of information this API provides (also, sorry Wunderground I still need to
slap your logo on the bottom of the page). 

This is all stuff for round two. I'm proud of this app. It's a quick and dirty POC for both systems which will provide
system specific direction and save us OODLES of time as we work towards a more polished release. I started out with 
exactly zero React Native skills and now I have a functional app. I've proved my ability to independently learn, troubleshoot, 
and deliver independently. Not only that, I've identified strengths and potential improvement to the product for future iteration. 
I'm communicating all of this to you with the hope that you'll see I'm passionate about technology: learning about it, talking about it, building it. I wont' promise I'm going to come into the office and teach you things you didn't know about algo/data structures, but I will pour my heart and soul into any task you want to throw at a full time dev turned intern. 

Enjoy the app!

Regards,
Paul

P.s. If you'd like more in depth commenting and documentation please let me know. I'm in the middle of a sprint right now so things are a bit hectic and I was more focused on function.
